# Pandas_Project_2: Data Cleaning & Storytelling

**Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories**. It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.

In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the core of the company.

Since the company went public, investors have been pushing for Eniac to scale up the business and become a major e-commerce player globally. It goes without saying that it is an arduous challenge to do so while retaining the human side of the business, which is Eniac’s emblem.

Here are some numbers that will help you understand Eniac’s scope (data from April 2017 to March 2018):

- Revenue: €14 million
- Average monthly revenue: €1.17 million
- Average order price: €710
- Average item price: €540



**Whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products**.

- The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
- The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
